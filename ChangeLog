2.1
	* SignalCacheModel to restrict the number of emitted statementsAdded and statementsRemoved signals
	  in a certain timeframe.
	* Raptor serializer now supports all raptor serializer factory names which are mapped to Soprano
	  user serialization types.
	* Changed mimetype of N-Triples to "application/n-triples"
	* New filter model DBusExportModel which exports a single Model via D-Bus.
	* The onto2vocabularyclass tool is now installed by default.
	* New sopranocmd feature: export only part of a model based on a SPARQL construct query.
	* Added OWL Lite resource instances for easy access to OWL Lite members
	* Finer grained control over the D-Bus server components:
	  Soprano::Server::DBusExportModel exports a single model
	  Soprano::Server::DBusExportIterator exports a single iterator
	* Finer grained access to objects exported via D-Bus:
	  the Soprano::Client::DBusXXXIterator classes provide thin wrappers around Soprano iterators
	  exported via D-Bus
	* New method IndexFilterModel::rebuildIndex to rebuild the complete index.
	
2.0.1
	* Fixed method statementCount in Sesame2 backend
	* Redland backend: Always encode strings as xls:string rather than rdfs:Literal values to match the 
	  Soprano guidelines.
	* Always set a dummy base URI in the raptor serializer
	* Fixed formatting of dateTime values.
	* Fixed NRL namespace
	* Fixed NAO namespace
	* Fixed plugin loading on MAC OS/X

2.0
	* LiteralValue is not derived from QVariant anymore but uses it internally
	* ResultSet renamed to QueryResultIterator
	* Fixed const'ness of many methods
	* Changed StatementIterator layout to match QueryResultIterator's layout using next() and current() methods.
	* Added vocabulary namespaces for usage of shared QUrl values for RDF/S and XML Schema URIs.
	* Added FilterModel class
	* Added RDF/S wrapper methods for easy access to RDF/S resource statements (RDFSchemaWrapper)
	* Added "apidox" build target for building the Soprano API documentation.
	* Added simple inferencing model based on rule files including a rule file parser.
	* Added an index filter model which creates a CLucene index of all literal statements.
	* Support for binary data in RDF literals encoded as base64 in LiteralValue
	* Added Vocabulary namespace containing basic ontology URIs such as RDF, RDFS, XML Schema, and NRL
	* TriG parser through raptor >= 1.4.16
	* NQuads (trivial extension of NTriples) parser and serializer
	* Soprano server library and simple daemon including D-Bus interface.
	* sopranocmd tool which allows to control the soprano server as well as work on the data directly
	  through the backends.
	* Working SPARQL ASK queries with rasqal >= 0.9.15
