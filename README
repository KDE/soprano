Soprano (formally known as QRDF) is a library which provides a nice Qt
interface to RDF storage solutions. It has a modular structure which 
allows to  replace the actual RDF storage implementation used. 

Currently two implementations are working. 

 - The first and most important backend used in Soprano is based
    on librdf, the Redland RDF Application Framework.
 
 -  The second backend is the more interesting one as it uses the
    NEPOMUK-KDE backbone library to connect to a NEPOMUK RDF triple
    service, thus providing a nice interface for applications not
    aware of Nepomuk services.
