Soprano 1.9.0
=============

Soprano (formally known as QRDF) is a library which provides a nice Qt
interface to RDF storage solutions. It has a modular structure which 
allows to  replace the actual RDF storage implementation used. 

Soprano has the following features:

* Full context (i.e. named graph support)
* Plugin structure for extensibility.
* Backend plugins for:
  - Redland
  - Sesame2
  - 3store (incomplete)
* A server and client lib which allows a simple remote
  Soprano server.
* Simple sopranod server application.
* Simple command line tool to perform commands on models in
  a Soprano server (sopranocmd)
* Rule-based Forward inference engine.
* Full-text index based on CLucene which indexes all literal 
  statements (i.e. those statements with a literal object node)
