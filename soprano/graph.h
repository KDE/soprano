     * \brief A simple collection of statements.
     *
     * A Graph is a simple in-memory collection of Statements. It is supposed
     * to be used where one needs a quick way to exchange or store a small number
     * of statements. It is basically a fancy QSet of statements.
     *
     * In comparison to Model it does not support queries, it does not use a specific
     * backend plugin, and it is not optimized in any way.
     *
     * One graph does not represent one named graph, i.e. one context, it can contain
     * Statements with different context nodes.
     *
