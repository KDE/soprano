     * \class Model model.h Soprano/Model
     *
     * \brief A Model is the central class in %Soprano. It is a queryable
     * collection of RDF quadruples, i.e statements.
     *
     * Model itself is just an interface for numerous implementations. (If you are looking for a simple container
     * for statements, see Graph.) There are basically two types of Models in %Soprano:
     *
     * \li StorageModel is the base class for Model implementations that actually store RDF quadruples.
     *     StorageModels are created transparently by %Soprano backend plugins: Backend::createModel()
     * \li FilterModel is the base class for all filter models. FilterModels can be stacked on top of
     *     a StorageModel to perform arbitrary tasks like inference or actual content filtering. An
     *     important FilterModel is Inference::InferenceModel.
     *
     * The simplest way to create a memory Model is to use the default Backend:
     *
     * \code
     * Model* memModel = Soprano::createModel();
     * \endcode
     *
     * <b>%Error handling:</b>
     *
     * Model is based on %Soprano's own error handling system which tries to emulate exceptions to a certain extend.
     * Most methods in Model have a means of reporting if an operation was successful or not. For additional error
     * information Model inherits ErrorCache which provides the method lastError().
     *
     * Thus, advanced error handling would look as follows:
     *
     * \code
     * Soprano::Model* model = Soprano::createModel();
     * Soprano::Statement invalidStatement;
     * if( model->addStatement( invalidStatement ) != Error::ErrorNone ) {
     *    showErrorMessage( model->lastError().message() );
     * }
     * \endcode
     *
     * For this to work properly Model implementations have to reset the error in each method
     * by either calling clearError() or setError().
     *
     * \sa \ref soprano_error_handling
     *
     * Model is thread-safe when used with a thread-safe backend (all "official" %Soprano backends are thread-safe).
     * However, it is recommended to create Model instances in the main thread.
     *
