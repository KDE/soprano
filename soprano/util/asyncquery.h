         * \class AsyncQuery asyncquery.h Soprano/Util/AsyncQuery
         *
         * \brief A wrapper around Soprano::Model which executes a query
         * in a separate thread and allows to iterate the results
         * asyncroneously.
         *
         * In contrast to AsyncModel everything is asyncroneous, not only
         * the execution of the query itself, but also the iteration.
         *
         * For executing a query asyncroneously simply use the static executeQuery()
         * method which will return a pointer to the newly created query object.
         *
         * AsyncQuery objects will always delete themselves once the end of
         * the iterator is reached and the finished signal has been emitted.
         * This also means that boolean results need to be read in a slot
         * connected to the finished() signal.
         *
         * Typical usage would be to connect to the nextReady() signal, use one of the
         * binding() methods or currentStatement() to get the current value, and then
         * call next() in it to trigger async iteration to the next element:
         *
         * \code
         * void MyQueryHandler::slotNextReady( Soprano::Util::AsyncQuery* query ) {
         *     // do something with the current value
         *     addToSomeList( query->binding(0) );
         *
         *     // trigger async iteration to the next element
         *     query->next();
         * }
         * \endcode
         *
