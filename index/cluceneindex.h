         *
         * \brief The CLuceneIndex provides a wrapper around a CLucene index
         * which stores RDF statements.
         *
         * It is used by the IndexFilterModel to actually handle the index. It has been
         * made visible in the public API to provide the possibility for advanced queries
         * and data modifications.
         *
         * CLuceneIndex is thread-safe.
         *
         * <b>Data organization</b>
         *
         * In the %Soprano index each resource gets its own clucene document. Only statements with literal
         * objects are indexed. The clucene is identified through the statements' subject and then a new
         * field is created that uses the statement's predicate as field name and the statement's object
         * as value. The index ignores all context information.
         *
         * \warning <b>The API is subject to change. Most likely CLucene classes will be wrapped and hidden from the public API.</b>
         *
