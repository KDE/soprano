         * \brief Central %Soprano server class.
         *
         * The %ServerCore provides a %Soprano server which maintains a set
         * of named Model instances that can be accessed by clients over
         * a tcp connection through Server::BackendPlugin.
         *
         * Creating a server is very simple: Either derive from ServerCore or
         * create an instance and then call start() to make the server listen
         * for incoming connections.
         *
         * \code
         * Soprano::Server::ServerCore core;
         * core.start();
         * \endcode
         *
         * Optionally ServerCore can be configured using normal BackendSetting
         * settings through setBackendSettings().
         *
         * Be aware the ServerCode supports multiple ways of communication.
         * start() opens a TCP socket to accept new connections, registerAsDBusObject()
         * registers a DBus interface on the DBus session bus. Both ways of
         * communication can be used simultaneously.
         *
         * ServerCore will spawn a new thread for each incoming TCP or local socket
         * connection. In addition the D-Bus interface is running in its own thread.
         * The maximum number of threads that are spawned can be set via setMaximumConnectionCount().
         * By default there is no restriction on the maximum thread count to keep
         * backwards compatibility.
         *
