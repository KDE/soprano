         * \brief Interface to a DBus server model.
         *
         * The DBusModel provides a fully functional interface
         * to a Model provided through a %Soprano DBus server.
         *
         * Given the DBus service name and the object path of the Model
         * in question it handles all DBus communication transparently.
         *
         * Normally there is no need to use this class directly as 
         * DBusClient does create instances of it on request.
         *
         * \warning DBusModel is not thread-safe by default
         * and has to be protected if is is to be used from different
         * threads (This can be done via Soprano::Util::MutexModel
         * in Soprano::Util::MutexModel::ReadWriteMultiThreading mode
         * or via setting the model to async mode via setAsyncCalls()).
         *
