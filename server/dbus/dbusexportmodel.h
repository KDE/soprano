         * \brief Exports a %Soprano Model via D-Bus.
         *
         * DBusExportModel is a FilterModel like any other. As such,
         * it can occur anywhere in a stack of models. However,
         * the model exported via D-Bus is actually the FilterModel::parentModel,
         * not the DBusExportModel itself. Thus, subclassing DBusExportModel
         * to modify the behaviour of methods called via D-Bus does not 
         * make sense. Instead stack the DBusExportModel on top of
         * your own custom FilterModel.
         *
         * For creating a simple %Soprano D-Bus server see 
         * ServerCore::registerAsDBusObject.
         *
         * The interface exported can be accessed via Client::DBusModel.
         *
         * DBusExportModel automatically makes use of a Util::AsyncModel as
         * parent model to create delayed D-Bus replies. If the parent model
         * is not a Util::AsyncModel all calls will be performed syncroneously.
         *
