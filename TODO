Soprano 2 TODO List

Add here what you want to add in Soprano

* threaded async inference: run inference in a different thread to make add and remove calls return quickly (as an option which can be configured)
* some reference counting in the inference model to properly handle removal of statements
* copy the types of the source statement's graph to the inference graph

Soprano 3:
* make Soprano::Backend::createModel non-virtual and let it call a virtual protected method. Then remove the Backend* paramter
  from the StorageModel constructor and have Backend set the Backend and the BackendSettings in Backend::createModel
* Make Soprano::Server::ServerCore::createModel const.
* Add transaction API including BackendFeature FeatureTransactionSupport:
  Model::startTransaction
  Model::commit
  Model::rollback
  (Only question: Can we support multiple transactions at the same time?)
  Idea: Create a transaction FilterModel that allows to have transactions on any backend in memory. Problem: queries!
