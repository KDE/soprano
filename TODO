Soprano 2 TODO List

Add here what you want to add in Soprano

* copy qHash(KUrl) since it apparently is much faster than our version

* some reference counting in the inference model to properly handle removal of statements
* copy the types of the source statement's graph to the inference graph
* Add error handling to server/clientconnection.cpp and server/serverconnection.cpp (disconnect on read or write error)

Soprano 3:
* make Soprano::Backend::createModel non-virtual and let it call a virtual protected method. Then remove the Backend* paramter
  from the StorageModel constructor and have Backend set the Backend and the BackendSettings in Backend::createModel
* Use QDbusObjectPath as return value for models and iterators in the DBus inteface
* Model should have yet another level of abstraction:
  - does not contain the write() and startTransaction methods
  - no QObject, ie. also no signals
  - maybe ModelBase or AbstractModel
* Transaction:
  - should be based on this new abstract Model class
  - no QObject (we do not need the signals here), thus could also be handled via TransactionBackend classes
* Idea: how about flags for Model::listStatements and executeQuery that include stuff like inference

Soprano 2.2:
- Transaction support in InferenceModel, IndexFilterModel, and Sesame2 backend
