The Soprano Sesame2 backend comes with the binary jars
of Sesame2 and Slf4j. This simplifies the installation a
lot since most Linux distributions do not ship Sesame2 yet.

To limit the size of the Soprano source package the Sesame2
and Slf4j sources are not bundled but can be downloaded from
the following locations:

slf4j-1.5.2.tar.gz
  http://www.slf4j.org/dist/slf4j-1.5.2.tar.gz

The Sesame2 sources are not bundled. They can be retrieved 
from the Aduna SVN server:
